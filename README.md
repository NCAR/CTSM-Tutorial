# Welcome to the 2022 CTSM mini-tutorial (WIP)
This repository includes materials for the [Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM)](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM) Spring 2022 mini-tutorial. 


These tutorials are designed as an introduction to running the Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM).  We we will run through three configurations that include running a:
1. Supported NEON tower site,
2. Global FATES simution, and
3. Generic single point simulation.
