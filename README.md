The materials and notebooks in this tutorial is published as a Jupyter book <a href="https://ncar.github.io/CTSM-Tutorial/README.html" target="_blank"> here</a>.

This repository includes materials for tutorials such as the <a href="https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM" target="_blank"> Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM)</a> 2022 mini-tutorial <a href="https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/events/2022/ctsm-tutorial/" target="_blank"> (link to agenda and resources)</a>. 

These tutorials are designed as an introduction to running the Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM).  We will go through three configurations that include running a:

0. Supported NEON tower site,
1. Global FATES-SP simulation, and
2. Generic single point simulation.  

We'll also learn how to: 
- Visualize results, 
- Analyze model output, and 
- Make simple code modifications.

This video will walk you through the initial steps of the tutorial, but the steps for quick start are also summarized below.

The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsqhY3nFckOF6VRh5gqpNAlHPgP3gLnXn" target="_blank">full set of lectures from the tutorial can be found here</a>, and will be posted after the tutorial.


# Quick Start
## Step 1: Open up CESM-Lab
- In your web browser go to the provided cloud link for the particular tutorial which you are attending.

  It will automatically open up a portal to connect to the cloud:

- Enter your username and password provided with your tutorial registration
- This should launch a JupyterLab window in your browser.

## Step 2: Clone CTSM Tutorial Repository
- Click on the `Terminal` icon to open a terminal window.

- Run the following command to clone this repository. (Just copy and paste the text below into the terminal window that opens in JupyterLab). You can also specify a particular branch which you'd like to clone, if you are interested in a particular tutorial. 

```
git clone https://github.com/NCAR/CTSM-Tutorial
```

This gives you a local copy of the material you'll need for the tutorial

*Can you see a new directory on your navigation sidebar called `CTSM-Tutorial`?* (See the left sidebar of your JupyterLab window)

## Step 3: Navigate to `notebooks` directory
- Click on the `CTSM-Tutorial` directory
- Click on the `notebooks` directory
- Click on the `Day0a_GitStarted.ipynb` notebook in the sidebar of your JupyterLab window.
