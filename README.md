# Welcome to the 2022 CTSM mini-tutorial (WIP)
This repository includes materials for the [Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM)](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM) Spring 2022 mini-tutorial. 


These tutorials are designed as an introduction to running the Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM).  We we will run through three configurations that include running a:

0. Supported NEON tower site,
1. Global FATES simution, and
2. Generic single point simulation.  

We'll also learn how to: 
- Visualize results, 
- Analize model output, and 
- Make simple code modifications.

# How to use this tutorial?

## This video will walk you through the initial steps of the tutorial, but they are also written below.


## Step 1: Open up CESM-Lab
- In your web browser go to https://ctsmworkshop.cesm.cloud/
- Enter your user name and passsword provided with your tutorial registration
- This should launch a JupyterLab window in your browser

## Step 2: Clone CTSM Tutorial Repository
Run the following command to clone this repository. (Just copy and paste the text below into the terminal window that opens in JupyterLab) 

```
git clone https://github.com/NCAR/CTSM-Tutorial-2022
```

This gives you a local copy of the material you'll need for the tutorial

*Can you see a new directory on your navigation sidebar called `CTSM-Tutorial-2022`?* (See the left side if your JupyterLab window)

## Step 3: Navigate to `notebooks` directory
- Click on the `CTSM-Tutorial-2022` directory
- Click on the `notebooks` directory
- Click on the `Day0a_GitStarted.ipynb` notebook in the sidebar of your JupyterLab window.

Now you're ready to get started with the pre-tutorial homework.  Let's git started by following along in the Day0a notebook
