The materials and notebooks in this tutorial is published as a Jupyter book <a href="https://ncar.github.io/CTSM-Tutorial/README.html" target="_blank"> here</a>. 

These tutorials are designed as an introduction to running the Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM).  Users can begin with the notebooks in the `Getting Started` directory, which contains:

1. An introduction to CTSM, CESM-Lab, and Git
2. Running CTSM simulations at NEON tower sites
3. Evaluating CTSM at NEON tower sites

We'll also have opportunities to explore more `advanced notebooks` which describe how to: 
- Make simple code modifications
- Change plant type
- etc

<!-- TODO: fill in additional advanced notebook topics -->

<!-- TODO: Do we want to include a video here like Adrianna's from 2022 Mini Tutorial? And an updated webpage for posted lectures after the tutorial? -->

The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsqhY3nFckOF6VRh5gqpNAlHPgP3gLnXn" target="_blank">full set of lectures from the tutorial can be found here</a>, and will be posted after the tutorial.


# Quick Start
## Step 1: Open up CESM-Lab
- In your web browser go to <a href="https://ctsmworkshop2023.cesm.cloud/" target="_blank"> https://ctsmworkshop2023.cesm.cloud/</a>

  It will automatically open up a portal to connect to the cloud:

- Enter your username and password provided with your tutorial registration
- This should launch a JupyterLab window in your browser.

## Step 2: Clone CTSM Tutorial Repository
- Click on the `Terminal` icon to open a terminal window.

- Run the following command to clone this repository. (Just copy and paste the text below into the terminal window that opens in JupyterLab) 

```
git clone -b NEON_Tutorial_2023 https://github.com/NCAR/CTSM-Tutorial
```

This gives you a local copy of the material you'll need for the tutorial

<!-- TODO: if we pre-stage everything, we may not actually have to do this? -->

*Can you see a new directory on your navigation sidebar called `CTSM-Tutorial`?* (See the left sidebar of your JupyterLab window)

## Step 3: Navigate to `notebooks` directory
- Click on the `CTSM-Tutorial` directory
- Click on the `notebooks` directory
- Click on the `GettingStarted` directory
- Click on the `1_GitStarted.ipynb` notebook in the sidebar of your JupyterLab window.

Now you're ready to get started with the pre-tutorial homework.  Let's get started by following along in the first notebook.
