The materials and notebooks in this tutorial is published as a Jupyter book <a href="https://ncar.github.io/CTSM-Tutorial/README.html" target="_blank"> here</a>. 

These tutorials are designed as an introduction to running the Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM).  Users can begin with the notebooks in the `Getting Started` directory, which contains:

1. An introduction to CTSM, CESM-Lab, and Git
2. Running CTSM simulations at NEON tower sites
3. Evaluating CTSM at NEON tower sites

We'll also have opportunities to explore more `ProjectExamples` which describe how to: 
- Plot data
- Make simple code modifications
- Change simulated plant type
- Change model options (eg, FATES)
- Identify how to change model output

# Quick Start
## Step 1: Open up CESM-Lab
- In your web browser go to <a href="https://neon2023.cesm.cloud" target="_blank">  https://neon2023.cesm.cloud </a>

  It will automatically open up a portal to connect to the cloud:

  ![Jupyterhub Login Page](/images/cesmlab_login.png)

- Enter your username and password provided with your tutorial registration
- This should launch a JupyterLab window in your browser.

## Step 2: Navigate to `notebooks` directory
- Click on the `CTSM-Tutorial` directory
- Click on the `notebooks` directory
- Click on the `GettingStarted` directory
- Click on the `1_GitStarted.ipynb` notebook in the sidebar of your JupyterLab window.

Now you're ready to get started with the pre-tutorial homework.  Let's get started by following along in the first notebook.


## IF you need to update the tutorial repository, you can clone CTSM Tutorial Repository:

- Click on the `Terminal` icon to open a terminal window.

- If the directory does not already exist (everything should be pre-staged, so you shouldn't have to do this), run the following command to clone this repository. (Just copy and paste the text below into the terminal window that opens in JupyterLab) 

```
git clone -b NEON_Tutorial_2023 https://github.com/NCAR/CTSM-Tutorial
```

Then, run the following command from within CTSM-Tutorial to update.

```
git pull
```


This gives you an updated local copy of the material you'll need for the tutorial

*Can you see a new directory on your navigation sidebar called `CTSM-Tutorial`?* (See the left sidebar of your JupyterLab window)
