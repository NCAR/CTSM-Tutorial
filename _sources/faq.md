# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

* **How can I access CESM-Lab after the tutorial?**
  - You can always find all the tutorial materials [here](https://ncar.github.io/CTSM-Tutorial-2022/README.html).
  - Your access to AWS will be depracted after this tutorial but you can access CESM-Lab using an AWS account (check with your lab or university).
  - You can also run CTSM using dockers on your own laptops. Details on running CTSM using containers through our CTSM-NEON tutorial tool are available [here](https://ncar.github.io/NEON-visualization/).

* **How can I transfer my progress/data outside the cloud or on another machine?**
  - You can transfer Jupyter notebooks, case directories, and other files you created or modified during the tutorial from CESM-Lab to your personal computer (or any other machine) using `rsync`.
      - Open a terminal window (or SSH into, for a machine like NCAR's Cheyenne) in the machine you would like the files transferred to. On Macs you can generally access a terminal via Applications > Utilities > Terminal. On Windows machines you may need to download a software like [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/).
      - Inside the terminal, navigate to the location you would like the files downloaded to and type:
        `rsync -avz <username>@ctsmworkshop2022.cesm.cloud:<full_path_of_file> .`
      - Your computer may say it cannot "recognize the authenticity of the host", but you can enter `yes`
      - Then you will be prompted to enter your CTSM Tutorial 2022 password (the password you used to log into CESM-Lab)
  - **Alternatively** on CESM-Lab you can directly download any individual files by right clicking on them in the left-hand file navigation pane and clicking `Download`. Directories can be downloaded by first `tar`-ing them (e.g. `tar -zcvf my_files.tar.gz clm_tutorial_cases`). Then right click on the tarred file in the file navigation pane to download it as you would a file.


* **I messed up the notebooks. How can I find what it should be??**

    You can look at the notebooks on GitHub and correct small mistakes, or you can do the following:
     - Open up terminal window
     - Navigate to CTSM-Tutorial-2022 directory (`cd ~/CTSM-Tutorial-2022`)
     - Run `git status` to check the status of your notebooks and which branch you are on.
     - If you are on the main branch, run `git stash` which stashes your progress and whatever you saved in your notebooks.
     - Next, run `git pull` to get a clean version of the tutorial notebooks from the original repository.

* **How do I see what jobs are running on AWS?**
  - You can either use `qstat` or `squeue` in terminal to list all your jobs and their status.
  - Below is the list of acronyms in the `ST` column and their meanings:

    | Status | Code | Description |
    | --- | ----------- | ----------- |
    | Completed | C | Job just successfully completed. |
    | Running | R | The Job is currently running. |
    | Queued/Waiting | Q / PD | The job is waiting for allocation in the queue. |


* **How do I kill a job thatâ€™s running?**
  - You can either use `qdel JOBID` or `scancel JOBID`. You should replace `JOBID` with the job ids that you'd want to stop. Please note that you can get your `JOBID` by using `qstat` or `squeue`.


* **I get a message saying that there is an existing directory and cannot run my code. What do I do??**

    * Remove the existing directory, which was likely created for an earlier failed case. Alternatively, if this error occurs when using the `run_neon` script, you can use the `--overwrite` option.

* **Which parameters need to have a re-build after changing them?**

    * You only need to rebuild if you've changed something in `env_build.xml` or `env_mach_pes.xml`. You can change `env_run.xml` or `user_nl_*` files without rebuilding. The only exception to that is if you are restarting and trying to change the years you are running over for DATM. For more information on when a rebuild is necessary, please see section 4.2 on [this website.](https://esmci.github.io/cime/versions/ufs_release_v1.0/html/users_guide/building-a-case.html)
