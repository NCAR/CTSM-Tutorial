    "# Tutorial 2b: Running a generic single-point case\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is an introduction to running single-point simulations of the Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM).  It will guide you through setting up the required driver data (i.e. surface and atmosphere data) as well as setting up and submitting a single-point CTSM case.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorial, `Day1_GlobalCase`, we set up and ran a global CTSM case. Many of the steps required to run a single-point case are similar, with some changes and additional required steps which we will cover here.\n",
