    "\n",
    "So far, we made a code change and saved it to a `local` branch. In reality, we usually want/need to push our changes back to GitHub so our collaborators can see, comment, or use our code modifications. \n",
    "Imagine saving your progress in a video game or in a Word document on a local computer. If you use a different computer, you can not load your progress. However, if you save your video game progress or your Word document on the cloud, you can easily access it from any computer. Nowadays, video games save your progress via a profile/account and Word documents can be saved and shared through Google or Dropbox accounts. \n",

    "\n",
    "In the future, you might want your code changes to be included on the CTSM main branch. The benefits of this are that everyone who forks CTSM can see and use your code modifications. Additionally, this will ensure that you do not need to continually update and resolve conflicts when new code developments are added to code you are using. We recommend talking with CTSM scientists and software engineers early in your code development process so that we are aware of your proposed code changes and can let you know about any potential conflicting code developments that are also in progress. \n",

On the right you should see \"head fork: YOUR_USER_NAME/CTSM\" and \"compare: MYBRANCH\" (where YOUR_USER_NAME will be your git username, and MYBRANCH will be the branch you'd like brought to the main CTSM code base).\n",
