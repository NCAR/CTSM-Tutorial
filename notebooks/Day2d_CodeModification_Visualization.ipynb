    "\n",
    "This tutorial is an introduction to analyzing results from your code modifications for the NEON Konza Prairie simulation. It uses results from the case you ran in the Day0b and Day2c tutorials, but you don't have to wait for those runs to complete before doing this tutorial. We've pre-staged model results from this simulation in a shared directory so that you can analyze results of your simulations regardless of whether they've completed.\n",

    "2. Increase knowledge of python packages and their utilities\n",
