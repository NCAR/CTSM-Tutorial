    "# Tutorial 1: Running global CTSM simulations \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is an introduction to running global scale simulations of the Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM).  It will guide you through running a simulation and provides example visualization of simulation results. Once you complete the global simulation in this tutorial, you can use the `Global_Visualization_Tutorial` to explore the model data further.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous `NEON_Simulation_Tutorial` example many steps to run CLM were condensed into a single function. Here you'll how to create your own case, setup, build, and run the simulation. *These are the basic steps reqired to run CLM and modify the code to conduct model experiments*\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### A few notes about the model:\n",
    "- There are several configuration options of CTSM, and throughout this tutorial we will use the Community Land Model (CLM) configuration which is the climate mode of CTSM. Throughout the rest of this tutorial, we refer to the model as CLM and will use version 5.1 with satelity phenology (**CLM5.1-SP**).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Satelite phenology (or SP)** simulations prescribe he distribution of vegetation and its leaf area index (LAI). These SP simulations useful for understanding water and energy fluxes that are simulated by the model, as well as gross primary productivity (GPP). SP simulations focus on the *biogeophysics* of the model.  Accordingly, there is no *biogeochemistry* (i.e., carbon fluxes) in SP simulations downstream of GPP calculations. This simplification removes potential feedbacks or biases that may occur from plant allocation, autotrophic respiration, and turnover on simulated LAI. SP simulations can be conducted with CLM5.1-SP, or with CLM_FATES-SP.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FATES** - the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator - is an external module which can run within a given “Host Land Model”, here we are using CLM.  This examples uses the satelite phenology scheme in FATES, one of the reduced complexity modes of FATES that helps to isolate representation of canopy processes like radiative transfer and photosynthesis. The full FATES model will allow researchers to investigate the influence of plant demographics and disturbance on ecosystem processes in a changing world with greater ecological realism than is possible with current vegetation model in CLM. FATES compsets are available in CLM.  \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional information:\n",
    "Additional information about CTSM and CLM is available [on the website](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/land/), including [technical documentation](https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/versions/master/html/tech_note/index.html), a [user's guide](https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/versions/master/html/users_guide/index.html), and a [quickstart guide](https://escomp.github.io/CESM/release-cesm2/quickstart.html#create-a-case) for running various model configurations beyond what is covered in this tutorial.\n",
