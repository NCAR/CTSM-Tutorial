    "This tutorial is an introduction to analyzing results from a global simulation.  It uses results from the case you ran in the 1a Tutorial, `Global_Simulations`, but do don't have to wait for those runs to complete before doing this tutorial too. We've prestaged model results from this simulation and another simulation using a different model configuration in a shared directory. This way, you can get started on analyzing simulations results before your simulations finish running and compare differences caused by model structure. \n",
