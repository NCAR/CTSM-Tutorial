    "\n",
    "This tutorial is an introduction to running single-point simulations of the Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM) at locations that do not have preconfigured options.  It will guide you through setting up the required driver data (i.e. surface and atmosphere data) as well as setting up and submitting a single-point CTSM case.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorial, `Day1a_GlobalCase`, we set up and ran a global CTSM case. Many of the steps required to run a single-point case are similar, with some changes and additional required steps which we will cover here.\n",

This accelerates the turnover time of \"slow\" ecosystem C and N pools (soil, wood, and coarse woody debris) so they come into equilibrium more quickly. \n",

In returning the turnover times of slow C and N pools to their intentended rates, we have to adjust the pool sizes from their \"AD\" steady-state. For example if the turnover of \"passive\" soil C was 10x faster in AD mode, the passive soil C pool needs to be 10x larger starting the post-AD simulation (the model automatically handles this conversion for you). Running the simulation for 100 years in post-AD mode allows the state variables to equilibrate with non-accelerated decomposition.
