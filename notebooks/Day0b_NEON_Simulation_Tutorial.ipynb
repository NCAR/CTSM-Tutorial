    "# Tutorial 0b: CTSM Simulations at NEON Tower Sites \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is an introduction to running the Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM) at [NEON tower sites](https://www.neonscience.org/).  It will guide you through running a simulation and provides example visualization of the simulation results. If you want to dive deeper, after you complete a NEON tower simulation in this tutorial, you can use the [NEON_Visualization_Tutorial](https://github.com/NCAR/NEON-visualization) to explore observation and model data further.\n",

    "**A few notes about the model:** There are several configuration options of CTSM, and throughout this tutorial we will use the Community Land Model (CLM) configuration which is the climate and biogeochemistry mode of CTSM. Throughout the rest of this tutorial, we refer to the model as CLM and will use version 5.1 with active biogeochemistry (CLM5.1-BGC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional information about CTSM and CLM is available [on the website](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/land/), including [technical documentation](https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/versions/master/html/tech_note/index.html), a [user's guide](https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/versions/master/html/users_guide/index.html), and a [quickstart guide](https://escomp.github.io/CESM/release-cesm2/quickstart.html#create-a-case) for running various model configurations beyond what is covered in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this example runs a single point case with data from a flux tower that's part of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).  You can find out more about the [NCAR-NEON collaboration at this website](https://github.com/NCAR/NEON-visualization).  This effort aims to links NCAR’s modeling capabilities with NEON’s measurement network through an NSF supported cyberinfrastructure project.\n",
