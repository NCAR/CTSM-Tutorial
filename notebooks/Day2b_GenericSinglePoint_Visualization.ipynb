    "This tutorial is an introduction to analyzing results from a single-point simulation.  It uses results from the case you ran in the 2a Tutorial, but you don't have to wait for those runs to complete before doing this tutorial too. We've prestaged model results from this simulation in a shared directory. This way, you can get started on analyzing simulations results before your simulations finish running. We also ran this case for longer (10 years instead of 1), so that we have more data to work with.\n",
