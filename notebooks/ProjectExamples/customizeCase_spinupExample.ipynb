It may be helpful to refer back to these tutorials if you have questions or want more information about creating an experimental case.\n",

    "data. In model experiments  we make modifications to namelist settings, the parameter files, surface dataset, or underlying model code we also need to generate new initial conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In runs with active biogoechemistry, like these NEON simulations, this means we need to get the ecosystem carbon and nigrogen pools with long turnover times into steady state. The turnover and decomposition of these slow pools is mathamatically accelerated in our AD (accelerated decomposition) case.  This means we:\n",
    "- Accelerate turnover of wood, litter and soil pools.\n",
    "- Accelerate advection and diffusion terms too\n",
    "- In CLM5 and CTSM5.1 this is calculated as a function of latitude so that spinup is more accelerated in high latitude regions.\n",

    "\n",
    "- During ad and postAD spinup, we just cycle over several years of input data.  For most NEON sites we cycle over four years of data from 2018-2021.  This also is the same time period we have data for running transient simulations, but as the NEON record gets longer, so too will these transient simulations.\n",
    "- During ad and postAD spinup we hold other inputs constant (e.g., atmospheric CO2 concentrations, N deposition, etc.).  For transient runs these inputs also change over time.\n",
    "- During ad spinup we accelerated the turnover of *slow* pools of C and N that normally have a long residence time in ecosystems (wood and soils).\n",
    "- During postAD runs we take away this accelerated decomposition and let the ecosystem settle into its equilibrium, or steady-state under 'normal conditions'. \n",
