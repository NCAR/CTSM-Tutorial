    "The above examples have calculated the mean and not changed units (*currently gC/m^2/s*).  Since each day has the same number of timesteps (48) and we are plotting diel cycles, the averaging and native units work. However, it is helpful to consider how data are being grouped in other types of averages and whether you might need to adjust the units.  For example, you may want to calculate a weighted mean at times (e.g. each month has a different number of days) or change units to make them better reflect your calculations. **You can think about this as you are working** by printing the outputs of  calculations at the end of each code cell and thinking about their dimensions, attributes, etc.\n",
