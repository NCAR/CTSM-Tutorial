    "CLM has different features that can be turned on or off with namelist changes.  Some of these features represent alternative hypotheses about how different aspects of how the land works. The different options have alternative model structure and parameterizations for particular processes that are controlled with namelist flags. These include:\n",
    "- FATES vs. 'BigLeaf' vegetation\n",

You can [learn more about PHS in this paper](https://doi.org/10.1029/2018MS001500), where Daniel Kennedy and co-authors mentioned hydraulic redistribution of soil water by plant roots. This happens in the real world too and is a pretty neat feature of PHS. Could hydraulic redistribution also be keeping surface soils in CLM too wet? To address this question we'll do a simple model experiment where we turn off PHS. This will revert back to the **BTRAN** formulation of soil moisture stress that was used in previous versions of CLM. \n",

    "We can turn of PHS with a simple namelist modification, but since this will change answers in the model, we also need to spin up the model again to generate new initial conditions with PHS off. "
