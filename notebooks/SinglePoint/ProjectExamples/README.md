These notebooks are project-specific and build upon the GettingStarted notebooks. They reference skills learned through the BuildingBlocks Notebooks.
     - Basic_CTSM-NEON_Plots.ipynb : This notebook shows how to create plots from NEON data, as well as perform time averaging, etc
     - CTSMsp_NEON_fromScratch.ipynb : This notebook focuses on using CTSM with satellite phenology
     - Clone_Case.ipynb : This notebook shares how to clone a case
     - FATES_NEON_fromScratch.ipynb : This notebook works on creating a FATES case from scratch with NEON
     - Plot_flux_climatology.ipynb : This notebook provides climatology plotting examples
     - QuickPlot_CTSM-FATESsp.ipynb : This notebook provides plotting tools for use with FATES run with satellite phenology
     - QuickPlot_CTSM_h0.ipynb : This plots monthly CTSM data
     - QuickPlot_CTSM_spinup.ipynb : This plots CTSM cases that have been spun up
     - customizeCase_PRISM.ipynb : This customizes a case to use PRISM precipitation input data
     - customizeCase_modelFeatures.ipynb : This customizes various model features
     - customizeCase_parameterModifications.ipynb : This notebook provides tools for parameter modifications and takes input that is generated from modifyParameterFile.ipynb
     - modifyParameterFile.ipynb : This notebook modifies a parameter file that can then be used by customizeCase_parameterModifications.ipynb
     - modifySurfdataFile.ipynb : This notebook modifies a surface data file that can then be used by customizeCase_modelFeatures.ipynb
